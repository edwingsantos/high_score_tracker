This project tracks the highscores of users, and compares them. It can show you some of the top scores for the games, has accounts with passwords, and admin functionality. It has multiple games to choose from, one of which is flappy bird. Each game has a score associated with it in each account, and there are different highscore leaderboards associated with each. There is also account creation which checks if your password and username don't exactly match another account.
